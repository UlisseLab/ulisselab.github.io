This website is powered by [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/)
and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and can be built in under 1 minute.
Literally. It uses the [`ananke` theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke)
which supports content on your front page.
Edit `/content/en/_index.md` to change what appears here. Delete `/content/en/_index.md`
if you don't want any content here.

Head over to the [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo) to get started.
